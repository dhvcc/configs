# README MAY NOT BE UP TO DATE

CERTAIN PACKAGE INSTALLS DID CHANGE. ONLY THE QUICK INSTALL SECTION IS FOR SURE UP TO DATE

# I PLAN TO REWRITE IT, MAY BE LATER

-----------------

# Configs

Basic showcase (neofetch is customized in this picture, `mint` theme used)

For GNOME desktop setup see [this repo](https://github.com/dhvcc/desktop).

## Quick Install

**Prerequisites are only `bash` / `curl` / `git` (macOS should have them installed by default, although git would need user input to install after prompt)**


This will move every conflicting file from home into ~/.config-backup directory, so you can return to backup if needed

```shell
curl -Lks https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dhvcc/configs/master/.cfg/install.sh | /bin/sh
exec bash
```

This will run the setup for all of the utils that you need to run this config

```shell
"$HOME/.cfg/setup.sh"
```

**Warning**, Bash configs may be outdated, use `zsh` as your default

## Configuration

- Any additional rc stuff for your `.zshrc` you can add into `.config/.rc_extend.sh`

### Neofetch
- `neofetch` can be turned off with `NEOFETCH=0` (in something like `.config/.rc_extend.sh`)
- you can override default neofetch settings with your own theme. Just add `export NEOFETCH_THEME=name_of_your_theme` to `.rc_extend.sh` and add your settings into `~/.config/neofetch/themes/name_of_your_theme.sh` file

----------------

# Sections below will be re-written because of the new installer

----------------

## TODO
- Don't default editor to VIM
- Fix aliases when command is not found (ls/vim)
- Better extensibility support (redo .rc_extend.sh and friends)
- Better docs
- Revert config script
- Helper command (something like cfg help?)
